# DocTr Packaging Summary

## 1. Project Reorganization
The project was reorganized into a standard Python package structure:
```
doctr/
├── doctr/  # Inner package directory
│   ├── __init__.py  # Package imports
│   ├── GeoTr.py
│   ├── IllTr.py
│   ├── seg.py
│   ├── inference.py
│   ├── inference_ill.py
│   ├── position_encoding.py
│   └── extractor.py
├── __init__.py  # Outer package imports
├── setup.py  # Setup configuration
├── pyproject.toml  # Poetry configuration
├── README.md
└── LICENSE.md
```

## 2. Package Building
We used Poetry to build the package:
```
cd doctr
poetry build
```

This created:
- A wheel file: `dist/doctr-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`
- A source distribution: `dist/doctr-0.1.0.tar.gz`

## 3. Package Installation
We installed the package in the existing virtual environment:
```
pip install doctr/dist/doctr-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

## 4. Package Testing
We verified the package by importing its components and confirmed they were accessible:
```python
from doctr import GeoTr, IllTr, U2NETP, GeoTr_Seg, rec
```

## 5. Documentation
We updated the README.md with installation and usage instructions for the pip package.

## Next Steps
- To publish to PyPI: `poetry publish`
- For local development: `pip install -e .`
- For CI/CD integration: Configure GitHub Actions or similar to automatically build and publish the package
